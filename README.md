Introduction
This project develops an IoT application using an ultrasonic sensor and a flame sensor to monitor real-time data. The data is displayed in a Tkinter application for easy visualization and analysis, useful for automation systems and fire detection.

Components
ESP32: Microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, processes sensor data.
Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures distance by emitting and receiving ultrasonic waves.
Flame Sensor: Detects fire or heat sources.
Tkinter Application: Python GUI for displaying sensor data in real-time.
Power Supply: Provides necessary power to the components.

System Architecture
Sensors collect data and send it to the ESP32.
ESP32 processes the data and sends it via Wi-Fi.
Wi-Fi transmits data to the Tkinter application.
Tkinter Application displays the data on a dashboard.

Challenges and Learnings
Sensor Integration: Required understanding of sensors and ESP32 specifications.
Data Transmission: Ensured reliable real-time data transmission over Wi-Fi.
GUI Development: Created an intuitive interface with Tkinter.
Debugging: Methodical approach to troubleshoot integration and transmission issues.

User Experience (UX) Design
Clear Layout: Separate sections for ultrasonic and flame sensor readings.
Visual Differentiation: Different colors and icons for each sensor type.
Real-Time Graphs: Visual representation of data trends over time.

Hardware Connections
Detailed images or diagrams of the final setup.
